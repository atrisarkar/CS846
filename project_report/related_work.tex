There has been some previous research which has proposed the idea of mining repositories to find simultaneously checked-in files to help developers in various ways. Zimmmerman05 and Ying04 have looked at the exactly same idea and proposed using association rule mining to dig out related files from the repository check-in data. However, both their strategies were designed keeping CVS in mind as the source control system and they had to do a lot of preprocessing on the data to fit it in their algorithm. Over the last decade, there has been in increasing focus on maintaining more metadata information in source control system. For example, Github has an open API which can be utilised to get commit information for any open source project in their system in a structured way. Our first objective is to study and review Zimmerman's and Ying's approach in the light of recent developments in open source repository systems and analyse how much of that research can be translated into today's systems and if we can enhance their methodology using this new information which we have today.
