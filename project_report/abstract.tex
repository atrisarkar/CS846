\subsection*{Abstract}
The success of open source software systems over the last decade has hugely impacted the way we develop software today. Considering the increasing popularity and participation of the developer community in open source software, maintaining quality is often a daunting task for project owners. In most open source software systems, project owners maintain quality by gatekeeping proposed changes and perform `Change Impact Analysis' of contributions by developers on a daily basis. In this project we develop a tool RICE (Review Impact with ConfidencE), which enables reviewers to easily analyze the impact of a proposed change. The tool mines historical commit data and uses association rule mining to discover the underlying impact a change may cause to the software system. We integrate our tool with the Pull Request UI in GitHub and evaluate its effectiveness on several popular open source projects.
